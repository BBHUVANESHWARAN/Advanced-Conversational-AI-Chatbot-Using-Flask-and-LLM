# **Advanced Conversational AI Chatbot Using Flask and LLM**

## **Overview**

This project involves enhancing a Flask-based chatbot by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) for advanced multi-turn conversations and domain-specific interactions. The upgraded chatbot leverages the capabilities of LLMs to understand and generate human-like responses, making it suitable for complex conversational tasks and personalized interactions in various domains.

## **Features**

- **LLM Integration:** Utilizes state-of-the-art LLMs to enable sophisticated and context-aware conversations.
- **Multi-Turn Conversations:** Supports engaging and coherent multi-turn dialogues with users.
- **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning:** Customizes the model for specific industries or topics to improve relevance and accuracy.
- **Flask-Based Deployment:** Provides a web-based interface for easy interaction and integration.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Web Framework:** Flask
- **Large Language Models:** GPT-4, BERT, or similar
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Version Control:** Git

## **Usage**

1. **Run the application:** Start the chatbot by executing the `app.py` file.
2. **Interact with the chatbot:** Access the web interface to engage in conversations with the bot.
3. **Customizable Responses:** The chatbot provides tailored responses based on domain-specific training and user interactions.

## **Dataset**

- The LLM was fine-tuned on domain-specific data to enhance conversational relevance.
- Dataset details and preparation scripts can be found in the `data` directory.

## **Results**

- The chatbot delivers high-quality, contextually relevant responses in multi-turn conversations.
- Performance metrics and user feedback are available in the `results` directory.

## **Contributing**

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request or open an Issue for any suggestions or improvements.

## **Acknowledgements**

- Special thanks to the developers of Flask and the LLM libraries for their contributions to this project.
